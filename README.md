# Time Series Forecasting – AirPassengers (Regresi & Neural Network)

This repository contains an end-to-end time series forecasting workflow using the AirPassengers dataset.
Two predictive models are implemented and compared:

Time Series Regression using lag features (lag1 & lag12)

Neural Network Forecasting using the neuralnet package

The analysis covers data preprocessing, transformation, lag construction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
